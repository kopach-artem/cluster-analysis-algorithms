# Cluster-Analysis-Algorithms

## About porject:

In this porject the main goal is to study the most popular algorithms of clusterisation.

I provide this list of clusteisation algorithms:

- K-Means (Python representation without "sklearn" (my implementation)/ C++ implementation with console output)
- K-Means++ (Python sklearn)
- DBSCAN (Python sklearn and C++ implementation)
- HDBSCAN (Python)
- GMM Gauss(Python)

For all of that we have GUI with manual start and simulation competition.

## Data Bank: 
Data bank base on diffrent types of files form open-source data banks. Like Illinoin University data bank of 3D model AI porject.

## Developer information:


## Future plans:
